# Stochastic Simulation course at University of Amsterdam

This is a repository for the the three assignments of the course [stochastic simulation](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2024-2025/zoek-vak/vak/11877) at University of Amsterdam.
The attempt of us at solving these assignments is within their own folder in this repository.

In the first assignment, we have used Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the area of the Mandelbrot Set using different sampling techniques.
Go to the [Assignment 1](https://github.com/NaniHazbolatow/5284STSI6Y/tree/main/Assignment%201) folder for further information.

In the second assignment, we have used Discrete event simulations to simulate queues with different queuing policies and different service distributions.
Go to the [Assignment 2](https://github.com/NaniHazbolatow/5284STSI6Y/tree/main/Assignment%202) folder for further information.
