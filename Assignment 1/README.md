# Monte Carlo integration of the Mandelbrot
In this repository the area of the Mandelbrot set has been estimated using four different sampling techniques.

## Mandelbrot set plot
Firstly the mandelbrot set has been plotted for which the mandelbrot series went to 100 iterations and shows also zoomed parts of it in certain regions.


## MonteCarlo Sampling
Talk about sample size and iterations and ways of sampling
### Sample sizes and iterations

### Sampling techniques
These four techniques are:
  1. Uniform random sampling
  2. Latin Hypercube sampling
  3. Orthogonal sampling
  4. Sobol sampling.

These sampling techniques were used for different sample sizes. These sample sizes were repeated for a number iteration
