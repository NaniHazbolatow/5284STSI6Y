# Monte Carlo integration of the Mandelbrot
In this repository the area of the Mandelbrot set has been estimated using four different sampling techniques.
Firstly the 
These four techniques are:
  1. Uniform random sampling
  2. Latin Hypercube sampling
  3. Orthogonal sampling
  4. Sobol sampling.

These sampling techniques were used for different sample sizes. These sample sizes were repeated for a number iteration
